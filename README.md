# Context

HistoryLink is passionate about sharing the history of our city with all those who live in and visit it - it is their goal to reach as many people as possible. By sharing local history, those in the area can gain a new appreciation for historical buildings and the stories behind them.

This is important because if history is not continuously shared and passed down, it is lost and the things that represent it lose meaning. Currently, there are options for tours around the Seattle Area, but none that go about it quite the same way. HistoryLink is a non-profit, the tours they provide are self-guided (ideal during COVID and for short notice decisions on what to do with your day), and their writers who are all very familiar with the area provide a unique experience with clear instructions on where to go and what to see. In order to do so, they need to increase the accessibility of their website.

By not acting on this, people who are interested in the history of the Seattle Area who speak languages other than English or have certain disabilities will not get to fully experience the tour, leading to a lack of feeling of inclusion and  potentially even a negative opinion of our city.

# Information Problem

As informatics students, we have learned that accessibility plays in integral role in making a successful technology, product, etc. As a team we will be looking at different levels and aspects of accessibility of the current historylink.tours and incorporate audio features for users to use along with creating an intuitive experience of the website as a whole.

When it comes to how intuitive the website currently is, our team will be breaking down the information architecture and check that the information is structured as it should be. We will analyze the current design of the website and review the previous user research HistoryLink has conducted to see what their findings were.

Although there are a few features relating to accessibility on the website currently such as screen reader capability and text translation, HistoryLink wants to incorporate audio features. Text-to-speech features are common and incorporating them into a website can vary in difficulty as the transition happens but there is research to be done as to how it can be made more accessible.

Overall, we are taking different aspects of our education through the iSchool to better the website our team will be working on. We will focus on the varying aspects of accessibility so that the varying users of the website can have a smooth process when using it.
